Data drives your modern life, and together we can make sense of it. Data is generated by almost everything we do, and often completely accessible for your own analysis. 

I want to help people understand the basic, intermediate and advanced concepts of data science. Statistics, data wrangling, analysis, models and visualization are my intellectual passions. 

I break down subjects to the brass tacks, clearly explaining key principles. Follow me on [Medium]() and join using this link in order to support my efforts. Your membership rate is the same low rate and I benefit from helping to grow this platform for writers.

I help people understand and use data models.
